# aurelia-vnext-instagram-clone

Building an Instagram clone from [this tutorial](https://medaium.com/fullstackio/tutorial-build-an-instagram-clone-with-vue-js-and-cssgram-24a9f3de0408) in Aurelia vNext to test it out.

The code is largely copy and pasted from this tutorial, changes have been made to make it work with Aurelia vNext, however the HTML and styling is largely the same here. The purpose of this example is to showcase how easy it is to build Aurelia applications based off other frameworks and libraries.

**Disclaimer**: Aurelia vNext is still not production ready, this example only serves to showcase how you can build apps in vNext, but some things are still missing that are needed for production ready applications.
